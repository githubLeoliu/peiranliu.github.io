I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Robotics and Autonomous Systems Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/robotics-and-autonomous-systems/). Before starting my Ph.D., I received my M.S. degree from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC San Diego](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/), where I was a member of the [Existential Robotics Lab](https://erl.ucsd.edu/). I received my B.S. degree from the [Department of Mathematics at UC San Diego](https://math.ucsd.edu/) as well.

My research interests broadly span robotics, with a particular focus on control, reinforcement learning, and whole-body locomotion. I am especially interested in developing scalable and generalizable control frameworks that enable robots to operate robustly in complex, real-world environments. Recently, my work has centered on learning-based locomotion for humanoid robots, integrating simulation-driven training with real-world deployment. I also have prior experience in other areas of robotics, including formal methods and safety-critical control.
